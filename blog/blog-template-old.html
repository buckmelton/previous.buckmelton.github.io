How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was ... interesting haha.  This was my first pairing ever, so I was getting used to navigating between what I needed to see on my monitor as navigator (essentially, the instructions for the pair challenge), and the screenshare my pair partner was sharing with me.  I'm only on a laptop with limited screen real estate, so that was a big challenge.  Other than that, it was fine.  We had some uncertainty over the fact that we were creating a web page without any real tools yet to position the top-level (or any) elements on the page.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Yes.  It helped to get straight in our heads what we thought the page should look like overall.  Wireframing helped us agree on the need and purpose for each part of the web page.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

My pair partner had already worked with Balsamiq during Phase 0, and I'd worked with Balsamiq in the past (just didn't have current fluency or setup on my computer) so we decided to stick with Balsamqiq which was really cool.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

In this particular exercise?  None that I didn't know about from previous Week 2 exercises. -->
