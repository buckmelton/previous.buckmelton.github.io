This week I've learned a bit about the command line and become more familiar with Git and GitHub. Now I'm going to write a blog to introduce these concepts to other beginners. In this post I'll be addressing:<br/><br/>

- What are the benefits of version control?<br/>
- How does git help you keep track of changes?<br/>
- Why use GitHub to store your code?<br/>

<ul>
  <li>What are the benefits of version control?<br/><br/>
    Version control allows you to encapsulate and track changes made to code.  In the event of a bug or unwanted behavior, this allows you to determine the cause by easily examining the differences in previous versions of the code and who made what changes when.  Whether or not you find the cause of the unwanted behavior, you can roll back the code to a previous known working point and proceed forward again from there.  Without version control, it would be extremely difficult or impossible to remember or find where all the various code changes were made in order to easily pinpoint when a problem was introduced, and it would likely be impossible (beyond a trivial change) to roll the code back to a known working point.<br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?<br/><br/>
    Git helps keep track of changes by allowing developers to work in separate copies ("branches") of the entire code base and to atomically merge those branches back into the master branch.  Git tracks all the changes that were made so the changes by a developer are encapsulated into a known change point, and can be rolled back if the changes cause a bug or unwanted behavior.  Git also allows you to inspect and easily see the differences between different save points of the code base.<br/><br/>
  </li>
  <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?<br/><br/>
    There are two crucial reasons for using GitHub to store your code.  First, GitHub, being in the cloud, allows developers to easily collaborate on a single repository, since each developer can easily download ("pull") the entire code base from GitHub to their local computer, work on it separately there, and merge their changes in a tightly controlled fashion back into the shared main ("master") code base.  Second, GitHub provides a convenient remote backup for your local files.<br/><br/>
